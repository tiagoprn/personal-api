Adding URL model

- [x] Add the URL model on models.py
- [x] Add a custom user model
- [x] Add the user as a foreign key to the URL model
- [x] Test the the api token generation is working with the new custom user model
- [x] Write tests to validate api token generation and refresh
- [x] Create a manager to `models.Url` so that it can get model instances from a given user.
- [x] Add `tests/test_models.py` - using real model instances in this case, not the model factories - to validate the implementation. Test `most_recent` and `from_user` separately and together
- [x] Implement the business methods on `core.services.urls`
- [x] Add manage command to populate the database with test data
- [ ] Run `python personal_api/manage.py populate_test_data` and fix the error where the signal is not called, until it successfully is
- [ ] Finish implementation of the tests marked with "TODO" (`test_models.py`).
