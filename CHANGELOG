Adding URL model

- [x] Add the URL model on models.py
- [x] Add a custom user model
- [x] Add the user as a foreign key to the URL model
- [x] Test the the api token generation is working with the new custom user model
- [x] Write tests to validate api token generation and refresh
- [x] Create a manager to `models.Url` so that it can get model instances from a given user.
- [ ] Add `tests/test_models.py` - using real model instances in this case, not the model factories - to validate the implementation. Test `most_recent` and `from_user` separately and together.
- [ ] Implement the business methods on `core.services.urls`
- [ ] On `models.Url.save()`, call `core.services.urls.shorten_url`
